Hey, I'm Reece (aka tylenol addict). I've been editing videos since 2017, and after graduating from Minnesota State University in 2019, I started editing full time. I am proficient in Vegas, After Effects, Photoshop, and know the basics of Premiere and Cinema 4D. If you wanna talk, message me on Twitter or email me.
